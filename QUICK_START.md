## ❌ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" or Connection Errors

**Solution:** Make sure the backend server is running!
- Use the one-click startup: `start_all.bat`
- Or manually start the backend first using `start_backend.bat`

### Port 8000 Already in Use

**Solution:** The backend is probably already running
- Check if you have another terminal window open with the backend
- Or close all terminals and start fresh with `start_all.bat`

### Browser Shows Old Errors

**Solution:** Clear browser cache
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` to hard refresh
2. Or clear browser cache completely
3. Close and reopen the browser
